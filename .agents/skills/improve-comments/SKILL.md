# Comment Guide for LLM-Generated Code

## Core Rule

Comments should explain **intent, constraints, and danger**.

They should not translate code into English.

A good comment answers questions the code cannot answer clearly by itself:

* Why does this exist?
* Why was this approach chosen?
* Why was an obvious alternative rejected?
* What domain rule is being enforced?
* What invariant must remain true?
* What external constraint shapes this code?
* What danger should future maintainers notice?

## First Prefer Clear Code

Before adding a comment, check whether the idea can be expressed better through:

* a clearer name
* a smaller function
* a stronger type
* a better module boundary
* a more explicit interface
* a simpler control flow

If the code can be clarified directly, improve the code instead of adding a comment.

## Good Comments Explain Why

Good comments explain reasoning, not mechanics.

```python
# We prefer freshness over provider priority here because stale severe-weather data is dangerous.
```

```python
# Invariant: all ranges in a Coverage share the same geometry.
```

```python
# Visual Crossing reports some hourly values in local time; normalize before merging.
```

## Bad Comments Repeat the Code

Avoid comments that simply narrate what the next line already says.

```python
# Increment i
i += 1
```

```python
# Loop over providers
for provider in providers:
    ...
```

```python
# Check if provider can answer the request
if provider.can_answer(selection):
    ...
```

These comments add noise without adding understanding.

## Comment Stable Knowledge

Prefer comments about things that are unlikely to change accidentally:

* domain rules
* invariants
* protocol contracts
* vendor quirks
* non-local consequences
* safety assumptions
* ordering requirements
* rejected design alternatives

Avoid comments that describe tiny implementation details likely to rot.

## Comment Where Wrong Assumptions Are Likely

Use comments when a future reader may make a plausible but wrong assumption.

```python
# Do not reorder these rules: later checks assume rain risk was already classified.
```

```python
# We do not cache raw vendor JSON here: cache readers need canonical Coverage semantics.
```

```python
# This module normalizes vendor weather semantics.
# It must not perform provider selection or fallback.
```

## Public API Comments

Public API comments should explain correct usage, expectations, and contract boundaries.

They should describe:

* what the caller may assume
* what the caller must provide
* what errors mean
* what is intentionally not guaranteed

Example:

```python
# Returns canonical Coverage in the provider's native geometry.
# If the selection specifies a lattice, the provider may homogenize onto that lattice.
```

## Internal Comments

Internal comments should explain why the implementation has this shape.

They are useful for:

* tricky domain logic
* external API weirdness
* performance-sensitive choices
* surprising ordering
* compatibility constraints
* intentionally ugly but necessary code

## TODO Comments

Always mark the temporary code, that will be dissolved/changed by some future work, with TODO (temporary) (and add reference to related doc/concern)

Keep the marker exact and put ownership after the colon, for example:
`TODO (temporary): [0117](path) replaces this shim.` Numeric IDs remain document references, not
part of the TODO syntax.

Other than that, TODO should name a concrete missing action.


Bad:
```python
# TODO: clean this horrible mess later
```

Good:
```python
# TODO: split provider normalization from HTTP retry policy.
```

Good TODOs should be actionable, specific, and easy to search.


## # @hotpath
Hotpath comment `# @hotpath` may appear at method or code block.
It means that this is important root flow of the program and deserves better comments inside. Do not delete comments inside hotpath blocks, but you can finetune or trim them when overexplaining.


## Avoid Comment Apologies

Do not use comments to excuse unclear code. Either make it clear, mark it with TODO or explain why the shape is chosen:

Bad:

```python
# Sorry, this is ugly but it works.
```

Better:

```python
# Provider returns mixed local/UTC timestamps; keep this branch until upstream fixes export format. Concern/doc ref ###
```

## Preferred Comment Targets

Prefer comments above:

* modules
* classes
* functions
* public APIs
* tricky blocks
* invariants
* dangerous assumptions

Avoid dense line-by-line comments, unless on hotpath and tell a story.

## Final Checklist

Before keeping a comment, ask:

1. Does it explain something the code cannot express clearly?
2. Will it still be true after small implementation changes?
3. Does it prevent a plausible future mistake?
4. Does it explain intent, constraint, or danger?
5. Is it more useful than improving the code itself?

If yes, keep it.

If not, remove it.

## Summary

Good comments preserve design intent.

Bad comments narrate syntax.

Write comments for the maintainer who understands the language, but does not yet understand the context.

If architecture entry/decision/description already exists, prefer link to docs instead elaborating on it.
