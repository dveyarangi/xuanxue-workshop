"""The open questions of the tree, kept in one store, and whether the store keeps its shape.

    uv run --offline --no-project python .agents/scripts/gw/questions.py --check
    uv run --offline --no-project python .agents/scripts/gw/questions.py --window --session <tag>
    uv run --offline --no-project python .agents/scripts/gw/questions.py --wake [--session <tag>]

    uv run --offline --no-project python .agents/scripts/gw/questions.py --tree [<q-id>]
    uv run --offline --no-project python .agents/scripts/gw/questions.py <event> ... --session <tag>

The store is `docs/questions/`: one file per question, its id nested under its parent's and its
parent line the one the check holds that id against, wholly closed subtrees in
`docs/questions/done/`, and `docs/questions/sessions`, where each running session keeps its
position. A re-parent renames the subtree that moves, across the records under `docs/`
(`.0020`'s decision 6). The formats are the questions skill's.

`--check` is the maintainer. It writes nothing; its exit status is the verdict and its JSON is for
the person reading a failure. A tree with no store has nothing to check and passes. `--window` is
what the agent reads before placing a message; `--wake` registers a session and reads where the
work stands; `--end` closes a session's line; `--tree` draws the live tree for a person. Each
event of a turn is its own call — `at`, `open`, `move`, `depend`, `undepend`, `close`, `suspect`,
`clear`, `lean`, `assign` — validated and written whole (parent decision 56); `--help` after any
of them says what it takes.
