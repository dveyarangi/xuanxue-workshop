# ticket — tracks a unit of work as a record with an outcome and observable criteria, from mint to close

- **instruction** `.agents/skills/ticket/SKILL.md` — the act: sizing, slicing, impacting the split, presenting the breakdown, minting
- **state** installed
- **record of** what must always hold

## How it works

A ticket is a tracked unit of work: an outcome, observable criteria, and the decisions it still
owns, held as one file whose shape is the format shelf's and whose state is a folder. The skill
says how work is sized and sliced into tickets and how a breakdown is approved; the shelf says
what a ticket is as a record — its name, its header, the sections its stage admits, what finishes
it and what removes it; the mover closes a finished ticket with its RFC and repairs every citation
that pointed at them; the maintainer holds every live ticket to the shelf's shape.

**Paired close is a behavior of this mechanism and `/maintain` is its actor.** The duty that a
finished ticket moves is written once, in this mechanism's rules file, and reaches `/maintain` as
an installed block; `/maintain` is not a part of this mechanism, it is the target the duty is
installed into. Two other skills act on a ticket rule in their own work and receive it the same
way: `/plan` names an RFC by its ticket, and `/align` lands a resolved decision in its durable
home and rewrites the ticket in place.

**A ticket holds what is actual at its stage** *(the user, 2026-09-08)*. Until its plan exists it
is incepted and hosts chunks — routed inputs, ideas, open questions. Once its plan exists it is
shaped and keeps the work, its criteria, and only what is still open; a resolved decision lives in
its durable home and in the session record, not in the ticket.

It is **installed**. A tree without it tracks work some other way; the parts table below is what
an installer adds and an uninstaller removes.

**Who decided each rule.** The skill and the shelf carry their rules with no attribution; this doc
carries it. A rule with a name and date is that person's to amend, through `/align`.

| rule | decided by |
|---|---|
| P1 — finished is every box checked, `/verify` included | the user, 2026-09-06 |
| P2, P3 — the pair closes in one invocation; the header is the maintainer's | the install RFC of 2026-09-06, which specified the mover |
| P5 — the records are checked by `tickets.py` | the user, 2026-09-08, owed to `/maintain`'s M1 |
| P6 — an RFC is named by its ticket | the user, 2026-09-08 |
| P7 — a resolved decision leaves the ticket for its durable home | the user, 2026-09-08 |
| P9 — a ticket is named by a link, or by a slug and its state | the user, 2026-09-21; the slug in the link text, 2026-09-26 |
| P10 — an align on a ticket opens with what the ticket is | the user, 2026-09-27 |
| P11 — the ticket is swept for consistency when the align ends | `/align`'s own text, moved here 2026-09-29 |
| P12 — the live tickets are read from the list | the user, 2026-10-10 |
| the record's shape — one header form, `Type` required, `Kind` gone, `Outcome` one sentence, the stage read from the plan, the sections a stage admits | the user, 2026-09-08 |
| the status vocabulary, numbering and one basename per work item | with the selected skills, 2026-09-06 |
| check-only, and nothing retires this | the user, 2026-09-08 |

## What it produces, and who reads it

- **The tickets** — *what it intends to become, what happened once closed* — read by `/plan` for what to build, by `/implement` for the same, by `/verify`
  for the criteria, by `/maintain` for whether each is finished, and through citations from every
  record that cites work by its slug.
- **The queue** — *what it intends to become* — read by `/recall` for the order and its candidate,
  and by whoever orders the work; written by hand.
- **The list** — *what exists* — read under P12 by whoever orders the queue or is about to mint a
  ticket; rendered from the headers on request by `tickets.py --list` and never committed.
- **The maintainer's report** — *what exists* — read by `/verify` through the verification set and by `/maintain`
  under P5. Its exit status is what the set consumes; its JSON is for the person reading a
  failure. It writes nothing.
- **The mover's report** — *what happened* — read by the maintainer who ran it: what moved, what was repaired, what
  it could not rewrite.
- **The rules file** — *what must always hold* — read by the installer alone, and by whoever amends a rule of this mechanism
  that another skill reads. Its blocks sit in `/maintain`, `/plan`, `/align`, `/recall`, `/ticket`
  and the entry file's general rules.

Nothing else. The register of tickets is the folder, which the list renders; nothing commits an
index of it.

## Not yet at the shape

**Two `not yet` rows**, each bound to an open question: the pacer, the installer.

**The maintainer reads names in `done/` and nothing else there.** A half-closed pair is caught by
name; an archived record written under an older shelf is never reported, and that is the
exemption working, not a gap.

## What retires this

Nothing. Tracking work is core to the method: a tracker that held the rows would move where the
record lives and would still need the method to say what a unit of work is, how it is sliced and
when it is done *(the user, 2026-09-08)*. The only condition that would retire it is all work being
done, which never arrives. This section states that so nobody re-investigates it.

## What would show it working, graded by someone who did not build it

One grader, pre-registered at the align that declared this mechanism and its `/plan`; a second,
the session that would have landed an archive listing, went with the listing.

**The session that declares `/plan`**
grades the pairing rule and the `Plan` bullet: did they hold against `/plan`'s own record shape,
or did this doc claim of an RFC what `/plan`'s declaration had to take back? A pairing check that
had to be moved out of `tickets.py` is this doc having claimed too much.
