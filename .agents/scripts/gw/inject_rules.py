"""A mechanism's rules reach other skills as installed blocks, from the one file that holds them.

One block per source per target, holding every rule the source sends there. A source is a
mechanism's rules file, or the project's own — `local.rules.md` beside the entry file, the slug
`local` — whose block lands after every mechanism's in a target and whose rules may name the
core rule each overrides. The grammar of the rules file is the format shelf's,
`MECHANISM-FORMAT.md`; the contract — a named mode or a refusal, every target validated before
anything is written, retraction byte-identical, a differing block refused until the caller says
overwrite — is the architecture's.

The script never decides what a rule means and never writes a doc.
