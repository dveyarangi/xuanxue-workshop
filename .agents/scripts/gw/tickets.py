"""What each live ticket declares in its header, and whether the record keeps its declared shape.

    uv run --offline --no-project python .agents/scripts/gw/tickets.py --check
    uv run --offline --no-project python .agents/scripts/gw/tickets.py --list

`--list` prints the live tickets as their headers say them, a markdown table in id order: the
ticket by id and slug, its status word, its type, its title, and the question it answers by id and
slug. It is the ticket list, rendered on request and never committed (the user, 2026-10-10); it
judges nothing, so a field a header lacks prints a dash, and a ticket it cannot read is named under
the table and fails the run.

The shape is the ticket format shelf's, `TICKET-FORMAT.md`, under *The record*: the mark of what
the ticket is a record of, the header's fields and their order, the sections a stage admits, the
acceptance boxes, and the pairing of an RFC with the ticket that shares its basename. The queue is
read for its mark alone. The question store is read for one thing: that a
ticket's `Answers` links an entry the ticket owns. This script rules on form alone. Whether a ticket
should have been written, whether its status is true, whether an outcome is any good, are
judgments it records and never makes.

Live rows only: an archived record is matched by name for pairing and opened for nothing. The
script writes nothing; its exit status is the verdict and its JSON is for the person reading a
failure.
