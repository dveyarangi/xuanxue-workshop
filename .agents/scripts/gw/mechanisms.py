"""What each mechanism declares itself to be made of, and whether the declaration is true.

    uv run --offline --no-project python .agents/scripts/gw/mechanisms.py --check
    uv run --offline --no-project python .agents/scripts/gw/mechanisms.py --index

`--check` reads every declaration under `.agents/mechanisms/` and reports its parts, its moments
and what does not hold; then it asks the reverse question — is every installed skill named by a
declaration, or does it say on its own first line that none does yet — and reports each skill
with who claims it; then it holds core to citing only what its mechanisms declare — every path
under `docs/` a core file names is a painted door, is skipped inside an instance-owned block, or
is a leak that fails the run, per AGENTS.md § Core and instance. In a recipient — a tree whose
entry file announces `<repository>@<ref>` — a `not yet` with no binding is upstream's gap, since
the harness mechanism sheared the binding and the reason on the way, and draws nothing; at the origin it
fails. `--index` renders the register from the same directories; no file holds it, and none is
written.

The script rules on form alone. Whether a moment should exist, whether an absence is honestly
classified, and whether the prose is any good are judgements it records and never makes.
