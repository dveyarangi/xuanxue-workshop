Reading a scope reports every operative `<straw-dog>` block in it — and, in code, every `TODO`
naming its ticket — as JSON, with the condition and owning ticket as written and a diagnostic for
anything a maintainer must look at. Guessing reports where a straw dog probably stands unwrapped,
from the words a sentence carries; a guess is for a person to judge and never fails the run.
Removing takes out one block a maintainer has already judged obsolete.

This tool never decides that a condition holds — it does not interpret an `until` phrase, and it
certainly does not execute one. Judgement is `/maintain`'s; the entry contract owns the syntax.
