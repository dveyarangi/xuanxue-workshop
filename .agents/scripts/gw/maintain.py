"""Which mechanisms are due for a re-check, from marks only a maintenance writes.

    uv run --offline --no-project python .agents/scripts/gw/maintain.py --check
    uv run --offline --no-project python .agents/scripts/gw/maintain.py --mark <mechanism> <level> <outcome>

A mechanism is checked at two levels. At `rules` its doc is due when the meta-rules moved since
its mark; at `output` its records are due when its own doc, rules file or skill moved since its
mark. A mark is the fingerprint of what a maintenance checked, written by `--mark` when the
maintenance finishes and by nothing else: no edit to a doc counts as a re-check. It keeps each
file's fingerprint too, so a level falling due names the files that moved, were added or went,
and the re-check reads those (the user, 2026-10-11). Dueness is derived at every look and never
stored. The marks' format is `/maintain`'s, in the format shelf beside its skill,
`MARKS-FORMAT.md`.

`--check` never fails on a due mechanism — being due is the news, not a defect — only on marks it
cannot read or a surface it cannot fingerprint. In a recipient the built-in mechanisms are
maintained where core is made, so the clock covers the recipient's own mechanisms alone.
