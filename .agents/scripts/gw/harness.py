"""Core reaches a tree that is not its own repository, from a fresh clone of that repository at a ref.

    python .agents/scripts/gw/harness.py <target> --install [--from REPOSITORY] [--at REF]
    python .agents/scripts/gw/harness.py <target> --update [--overwrite] [--from REPOSITORY] [--at REF]
    python .agents/scripts/gw/harness.py <target> --check [--from REPOSITORY]

The source is always the repository, cloned whole and without a checkout into a temporary
directory and read through git, so what a recipient receives is what a commit holds and never a
working tree. What ships is every file under the core directory at the ref plus the entry file and
the host stub, transformed in memory before a byte is written: the origin's own local blocks
removed, every straw-dog wrapper and every TODO's question binding sheared with its content kept, the
entry file's announce line stamped `<repository>@<ref>, <date>`, and the result held to the leak
rule the origin's check applies. That line is the recipient's only revision record; a check clones
the announced ref again and compares. Every refusal writes nothing. A loader link the platform
refuses to create is not a refusal: everything else lands, and the report carries the exact command
for the person. The contract is the architecture's; the decisions are the install spec's.
